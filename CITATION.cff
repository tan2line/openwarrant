abstract: >-
  OpenWarrant is an open-source, runtime-agnostic governance library that
  enables AI agents to prove they had authority to act. It introduces the
  warrants-as-skills paradigm, where governance checks are implemented as
  native agent skills — upstream dependencies in the execution graph that
  are externally authored, cryptographically signed, and institutionally
  issued. The library has zero framework dependencies and works with any
  agent runtime through optional thin adapters.
